## What is Shiny?	
* interactive web applications (R-backend, Pretty front-end)
    - If you can do it in R, you can put into an app
    - _Plus_ pretty front-end & interactivity 
    - Users don't need to worry about code
* many modes of delivery
    - Hosted online (free and pay options, or host your own) 
    - On your own computer (i.e., locally)
    - Embedded in Rmarkdown documents (e.g., slides)
 

## What's it good for? 
* Anything where **_interaction_** improves learning or understanding... 
  * working with data, model, map, etc.
* Research tools
	* Here's a model, what if I tweak these parameters?
	  - (https://brunnerlab.shinyapps.io/Tick_Matrix_Model/)
	* Here's a bit of a data set, what if I slice it this way or that?
	  - (https://brunnerlab.shinyapps.io/GRRS_Interactive/)
* Conveying information, data, predictions, etc. to a wider audience
	* Virtually every EEID grant I've read includes a Shiny module for outreach
* **Teaching tools** <-- today's topic  

## Teaching Use cases
* **Illustrate a concept** or let students **play with an idea** 
  - Pair with readings or lecture
  - Use for more **interactive homework** 
    - e.g., play with simulations/data, then answer questions
* Use for **in-class exercises** (individually, in groups, as a class)
	* make predictions and see consequences
	* work with data (e.g., make plots, do calculations)
* Use **in labs**
	* **streamline analyses** / remove coding 
	  - e.g., do stats or calculations for students to get to the point faster
	* create **simulations** to see consequences, make decisions, answer questions
	* **work with real-world data** without having to worry about coding
* Create **learn-on-your-own interactive exercises**, especially for learning R.

## Example: playing with exponential growth {.smaller}
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  "~/Documents/Teaching/EcoHealthDis_370_F2021/EcoHealthDis_Interactive/ExponentialGrowth/",
  options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
)
```
https://brunnerlab.shinyapps.io/ExponentialGrowth/


## Example: playing with logistic growth {.smaller}
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  "~/Documents/Teaching/EcoHealthDis_370_F2021/EcoHealthDis_Interactive/LogisticGrowth/",
  options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
)
```

## Example: playing with compartment models {.smaller}
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  "~/Documents/Teaching/EcoHealthDis_370_F2021/EcoHealthDis_Interactive/SEIR/",
  options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
)
```

## I'm sold...how do I make my own? 
<div class='left' style='float:left;width:30%'>
![](MasteringShiny.png){width=60%}</div>
<div class='right' style='float:right;width:65%'>
* Comprehensive online book (https://mastering-shiny.org/)
* Online tutorials (https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)
* Seminars/talks (e.g., https://ecoforecast.org/workshops/r-shiny-seminar-series/)
* Adapt existing apps <-- _How I got started_
* lean on your R-savvy students & colleagues</div>






## I'm sold...but I don't code

Find existing apps

* Collections of apps available
  - e.g., ecology & evolution apps made by UCLA EEB grads (https://ecoevoapps.gitlab.io/)
  - introductory statistical ideas (e.g., https://facweb.gvsu.edu/adriand1/happy_apps.html one of _many_)
* Creative googling & Twitter are your friends
* Consider contacting the creators...
  - In my experience, they often make changes I've asked for!
